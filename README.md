## Environment Setup

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_project_url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your_supabase_anon_key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your_supabase_service_role_key>
```

## Supabase Configuration

1. Environment Variables

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_project_url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your_supabase_anon_key>
```

2. Deployment Steps

- Local development: Use `.env.local` file
- Production: Add environment variables in your deployment platform (e.g., Vercel)
  - Go to Project Settings
  - Navigate to Environment Variables section
  - Add both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - Redeploy the application

3. Database Setup

- Create `contact_submissions` table:

  ```sql
  create table public.contact_submissions (
    id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
    created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
    name varchar not null,
    email varchar not null,
    phone varchar,
    wechat varchar,
    address text,
    zipcode varchar,
    message text not null,
    staus varchar
  );
  ```
- Enable Row Level Security and create policies:

  ```sql
  -- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
  alter table public.contact_submissions enable row level security;

  -- Allow inserts for all users
  alter policy "Enable insert for all users"
  on "public"."contact_submissions"
  to public
  for insert
  with check (
    true
  );
  ```

## Supabase Keep-Alive Setup

To prevent the Supabase free tier database from hibernating, we've implemented an automated keep-alive system using GitHub Actions.

### 1. Create Heartbeats Table

Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
create table heartbeats (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  timestamp timestamptz not null default now(),
  source text not null,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

-- Optional: Add a policy to automatically delete old records
create policy "Delete old heartbeats" on heartbeats
  for delete using (created_at < now() - interval '30 days');

-- Optional: Enable RLS
alter table heartbeats enable row level security;

-- Optional: Add policy for service role
create policy "Service role can insert heartbeats"
  on heartbeats for insert
  with check (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to "Settings" -> "Secrets and variables" -> "Actions"
3. Add the following repository secrets:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Your Supabase service role key (not the anon key)

### 3. Setup Files

The repository includes two key files for the keep-alive system:

- `scripts/keep-alive.ts`: Script that sends heartbeat to Supabase
- `.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow configuration

### 4. Schedule

The keep-alive script runs automatically:

- Every Monday and Friday at 8:00 AM Pacific Time
- Can be manually triggered from the GitHub Actions tab

### 5. Monitoring

Monitor the keep-alive system:

1. Go to your GitHub repository's "Actions" tab
2. Look for the "Supabase Keep-Alive" workflow
3. Check the run history and logs
4. Manually trigger runs using the "Run workflow" button

### 6. Verification

You can verify the system is working by:

- Checking the GitHub Actions run logs
- Viewing the `heartbeats` table in your Supabase dashboard
- Monitoring your database's active status

## Run the Development Server

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Before Deployment

There is a Github Account, MeiyuTech, belongs to Meiyu Group and forks this repository. MeiyuTech needs to pull the latest changes from this repository and merge them into its own repository, and then deploy to Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
