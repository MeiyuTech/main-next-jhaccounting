## How to Obtain an ITIN for Non-Residents in the US?

The following documents are generally required:
- Passport (stand-alone document);
- National ID card (must show photo, name, current address, date of birth, and expiration date);
- U.S. driver’s license;
- Birth certificate (required for dependents under 18).

Additionally, applicants need to complete Form W-7, "IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) Application," and submit it along with their tax return.

## How Much Does ITIN Application Cost?

There is no fee charged by the IRS to apply for an ITIN.

## Is ITIN the Same as SSN?

No, ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number) is issued by the IRS, whereas SSN (Social Security Number) is issued by the Social Security Administration:
- ITIN cannot be used for employment purposes;
- ITIN is solely for tax purposes.

## Can I Get an ITIN If I Don’t Live in the US?

Yes, regardless of immigration status, both resident and non-resident aliens may need an ITIN to file or report taxes under U.S. tax law. Unless exceptions apply, individuals must meet filing requirements and submit a valid federal income tax return to obtain an ITIN.

## How Long Is an ITIN Valid?

An ITIN is valid for three consecutive years. If not used on a federal tax return for three years, it will need to be re-applied for.

## How Long Does It Take to Get an ITIN Approved?

If the applicant is eligible and the application is complete, it typically takes about 7 weeks to receive an ITIN letter from the IRS. During the peak tax season (January 15 to April 30) or for applications submitted from abroad, it may take up to 11 weeks.

## Who Should Apply for an ITIN?

Anyone who needs to file a tax return but does not have an SSN should apply for an ITIN. An ITIN allows individuals to file taxes but does not qualify them for certain benefits.
